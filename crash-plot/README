This contains the data and code related to the crash rate plot in the published Bike Count document.

query.sql -- query used to fetch the CSV data from the crash database operated by azbikelaw.org
and loaded with "Crash Mart" data from ADOT (Arizona Department of Transportation).  The output
of this is saved as eg bikecrash_2009.csv, etc, for whichever year it is run.  Modify it for
whichever year before running it.

bikecrash_2009.csv -- output of the query.sql query when run for various years
bikecrash_2010.csv
bikecrash_2011.csv
bikecrash_2012.csv
bikecrash_2013.csv

associate.pl -- perl script.  Takes those (combined) and outputs 'bikecrash_all_years_associated.csv',
a version of only crash sites that are within 500 meters of an crash site, along with that nearest
crash site.
Adds these columns:
'nearest_count_site' is a site ID like 123.
'distance_to_nearest_count_site' is in units of lat/long, mixed via Pythagoras' theorum
Collisions without a count site within 500 meters have null data in those columns.

vis.R -- R ggmap visualization; takes 'bikecrash_all_years_associated.csv.csv' from
associate.pl and ../count_sites.csv as input
Run with the command:  R -f vis.R
Outputs 'Rplots.pdf'
